### Project Goals

With so many businesses and services to support in southern Vermont, the Deerfield Valley chamber needed a website that would allow visitors to easily sort through and find business listings to meet their needs. 

10F worked closely with them to analyze their existing website content and to develop a more organized and effective website structure. Additionally, we improved website usability by developing customized sorting functionality, designed to help visitors find what they are looking for.
