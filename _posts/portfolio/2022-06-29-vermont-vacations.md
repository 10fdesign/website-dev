Tourism is one of the largest industries in Vermont, as the state welcomes over 13 million visitors each year. The State of Vermont Chamber of Commerce’s mission is to promote Vermont’s travel, recreation, cultural and historic attractions, as well as the state’s goods and services, in a manner consistent with the values and traditions of the state for the economic benefit of all Vermonters.

### Project Goals

As Vermont’s tourism industry continued to grow, the chamber needed a website that would allow visitors to easily research and explore businesses and services across the state. They also needed an improved user portal to allow new businesses to submit and manage their own listings.
