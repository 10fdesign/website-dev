The Wolf Kahn Foundation is Brattleboro-based organization dedicated to preserving and promoting the artistic achievements of Wolf Kahn (1927-2020).

Through its grants program and other initiatives, the Foundation supports artists and arts organizations that educate youth and the broader public and that advance artists’ careers through exhibitions, publications, and residencies.

### Project Goals

Due to the nature of their work, the Wolf Kahn Foundation wanted an aesthetically pleasing website that would highlight aspects of the artist’s work. 10F collaborated closely with the client on developing the website’s overall look and feel through multiple stages of website mockups.
