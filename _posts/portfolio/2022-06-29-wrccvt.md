### Project Goals

WRCC approached 10F with the goal of consolidating and wrangling their sprawling sitemap as well as redesigning the site for improved clarity and useability. 

We took a highly collaborative approach with WRCC, guiding them through a strategic process that helped us hone in on their goals and provide them with long-term value. 

Through this strategic partnership, we were able to condense the website content and improve the information architecture to better serve WRCC students.
