Established in 1945, Stowe Area Association (SAA) is a member-based marketing and sales organization. Their mission is to market and sell the natural beauty of Stowe, its cultural and recreational opportunities and member businesses.

### Project Goals

As a directory site featuring over three hundred listings, Stowe Area Association was looking to streamline their website and increase potential Stowe visitors’ ability to use it as a research tool. We condensed their website significantly, opting to implement an advanced search function based on their listing categories.

Since completing their website design, 10F has continued to work closely with Stowe Area Association to constantly improve their website’s features and functionality.
