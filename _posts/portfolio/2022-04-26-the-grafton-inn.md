Founded in 1801, the historic Grafton Inn is a quintessential southern Vermont country inn. The inn features 42 individually appointed rooms, including seven suites and four guest houses. On-site dining is provided in one of two unique spaces; the Phelps Barn Pub which was once the Inn's carriage house, and the 1801 Tavern located within the Main Inn.

### Project Goals

The Grafton Inn was looking to update their image to resonate with a more modern audience while still maintaining their historical charm. To craft this design, we conducted an in-depth industry analysis and content strategy to ensure that their website was meeting modern design standards. We used color, photography, and subtle animations to bring their brand to life.
