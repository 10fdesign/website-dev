Our team of web developers and designers excel at creating websites that meet our client’s needs and delight their customers. We specialize in mobile-first design, streamlined user experiences, and custom functionality. 

### Web development and design

Design that inspires your customers and achieves your business goals. 

We are a southern Vermont based company that develops websites designed to grow with your business. We specialize in coding WordPress, Shopify, and Ruby on Rails solutions that delight our clients while staying on schedule and on budget. 

### User Oriented Design

Your customers need a website that is easy to navigate and use. It’s a simple idea, but one that far too many websites fail to achieve. Let us set your business apart by creating a streamlined and thoughtful design that supports your customer’s journey and provides them with a friction-less user experience. 

### Mobile-First Design

More than half of all visitors to your website will be from a mobile device or tablet, and that number is only going to rise. And it’s not only customers who are prioritizing mobile — Google is moving toward mobile-first indexing for determining your website’s organic ranking. 

At 10F, we begin this design process by prioritizing mobile usability and accessibility, ensuring that customers on all devices will have an exceptional experience. 

### Content Management Capability

Your business is constantly evolving, and we know you need a website that can grow and change along with it. We’ll make sure you can maintain control of your website and easily make changes on the fly with a custom content management system (CMS). As with all other parts of your website, we’ll design your CMS to suit your specific business needs so that you can do things like craft blog posts, add listings, share events, and update images without the help of a web developer. 

### More than just an SEO paragraph

Try to learn from competitor sites which are regularly vague and opaque

### Wordpress, Ruby on Rails, Shopify, others

### Managed hosting

Take website hosting off your plate, and let us help you stay connected with the world. 10F Design provides managed website hosting in partnership with top-tier hosting providers such as WP Engine, XX, and XX. 

Our team performs regular maintenance and updates to ensure that your website continues to run smoothly and efficiently. We’ll also be on call to help you if and when your site goes down.

Might be cool to have a cloud of all the logos of all the sites we manage, since there are some good local ones in there (e.g. Brattleboro Chamber of Commerce, Back Roads, Stevens & Associates)
