### Hosting

We offer a few different options for ongoing technical support. If we go with Wordpress, hosting is $35/mo on WPEngine, the premier Wordpress host. For $99/mo (hosting included), we will also perform monthly plugin and Wordpress core updates to keep your site up to date and secure. If you stay on your existing hosting, there will obviously be no additional charge to you.

### Ongoing Technical Support

We offer monthly technical support plans at our regular $95/hr rate. For example, a 2 hour monthly plan buys you 2 hours of tech support for $190 on retainer. These monthly plans (billed in advance in 12 month chunks) let us build free time into our schedule so that we can guarantee that we have capacity for your requests.

If you donâ€™t go for a monthly support plan, we offer emergency tech support on an as-needed basis, but at a higher $135/hr rate.

Yearly support contracts with hourly monthly support built in:
- 2hrs ($95/hr) - +$190 per month billed annually. ($2.280)
- 4hrs ($95/hr) - +$380 per month billed annually. ($4,560)
- 8hrs ($95/hr) - +$760 per month billed annually. ($9,120)
